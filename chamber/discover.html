                <h2>Discover More About Hilo Hawaii</h2>
                <p class="discover-p">Hilo is full of sacred areas. People came to Hilo around 1100 AD. 
                    They set up fishing spots and built up the land. Many of the fish 
                    ponds are very sacred and not for swimming. Hawaiian culture 
                    is all about showing your gratitude to the land. They fish and 
                    farm and are very grateful for the food the land has provided for 
                    them. Hilo is a very creative area full of many centers for the arts. 
                    Hula, pottery, paddling and many other fun and creative 
                    activities. Hilo is in the jungle of Hawaii. Most beaches are 
                    black sand and cold water. There are so many waterfalls that most 
                    have not even been found yet. The population of Hilo was 45,248 in 2020.</p>

                    <p class="text">#5 - Rainbow falls is a waterfall that falls over a lava cave known 
                        in Hawaiian legends as the home of the goddess Hina. It is 
                        called rainbow falls because most mornings, the mist from the 
                        falls will create a rainbow. Rainbow falls is part of the 
                        Wailuku River.</p>
